Choosing an EfficientDet model involves a trade-off between accuracy and performance, which depends on the use case. For example, if the model needs to be deployed on an edge device, then a small variant should be used. Similarly, if the goal is to use the model for real-time video analysis, a smaller variant would be preferred because it provides higher frames per second (FPS). On the other hand, larger variants are suitable for those tasks that tolerate longer inference time, e.g. one-time analysis of static images, as they show better results in terms of accuracy.
